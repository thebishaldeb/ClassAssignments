## Assignment 2

Suppose we have locations of n cities as x,y coordinates. You can plot the coordinates of the locations in a plane. You have to find out the cities which are located the nearest to each other. 

You cannot use exhaustive comparison to find out the answer. The implementation with the lowest time complexity will get the highest marks. Also, take the inputs from a text file.

Your program must contain comments for every non-trivial block of code so that it is easy to understand.

Upload your program file below. You have to explain the program in the next class. 

#### Input file example: 
The first line will indicate the number of cities & the subsequent lines will contain the name of the city and their coordinates. Your file should contain at least 25 cities.

```

4

Guwahati (0,1)

Kolkata (5,3)

Delhi (8,-6)

Mumbai (5,-5)

```

Output: Guwahati & Kolkata are the closest with distance 5.38 units.

### Solution

 `main.py` has the main program and `cities.txt` has the databases.
