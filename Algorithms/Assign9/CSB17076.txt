                      Assignment 9
                                        
Objective: Reconstructing the original message/string

Input:     strings that are part of the original string/message
           <some strings can occur multiple times>

Constrains: Input strings are overlappable--either at front(prefix) or at back (postfix)

Algorithm/Pseudocode:
    First Input is taken from the file and stored as a node.
    
    We will make a weighted graph representing the relation of one string to other and the weights would be calculated by the overlaping factor and the length of the strings.

    We will pick up a node and traverse to its neighbour with the highest weight and combine the two strings (or maybe completely absorbed).

    We will keep on traversing till we find no suitable neighbours to traverse to.

    The ending overlap all the substrings and that would give us the resultant string.

Proof:
    Since the resultant string will be able to absorb all the provided substrings therefore it is the only possible combination of the substrings.
